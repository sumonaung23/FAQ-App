        id: 3,
        question: "How do AI agents work?",
        answer: "AI agents use a combination of data, algorithms, and predefined goals to make decisions. They collect inputs from their environment, process them using AI models, and perform actions to optimize results based on their objectives."
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        question: "What are the main types of AI?",
        answer: "AI is typically categorized into three types: Narrow AI (focused on specific tasks like voice recognition), General AI (capable of human-like reasoning), and Super AI (hypothetical intelligence surpassing human capabilities)."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "Where are AI agents used in real life?",
        answer: "AI agents are used in customer service chatbots, personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation engines (Netflix, YouTube), self-driving cars, healthcare diagnosis tools, and automation systems in businesses."
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "Are AI agents safe to use?",
        answer: "AI agents are generally safe when designed responsibly. However, risks can arise from biased data, lack of transparency, or misuse. Proper regulation, testing, and ethical standards help ensure AI safety and reliability."
    },
    {
        id: 7,
        question: "How can I start building my own AI agent?",
        answer: "To build your own AI agent, start by learning basic programming (Python or JavaScript), understand machine learning fundamentals, and explore frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenAIâ€™s API for natural language processing."
